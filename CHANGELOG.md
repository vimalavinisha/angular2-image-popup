# 5.7.1
### Bugfixes
- getDescriptionToDisplay is used in current-image.html also for titles. So, when strategy is ALWAYS_HIDDEN,
  titles will be always ‘’. That’s wrong, because I should hide only descriptions not titles (useful for accessibility purposes)!

### Examples

### Others
- add angular-modal-gallery 6.0.0 warning in README.md (release scheduled for May 2018)

### Breaking changes
- `hammerjs` and `mousetrap` are mandatory libraries (install they with `npm install --save hammerjs mousetrap`).
- `(cancelEvent)="myfunction($event)"` replaced by `(close)="myfunction($event)"`.
- `<imageModal></imageModal>` replaced by `<modal-gallery></modal-gallery>`.
- You have to init input images with an `Array<Image>` or an `Observable<Array<Image>>` as explained [HERE](https://ks89.github.io/angular-modal-gallery.github.io/).

### New features
- swipe support for mobile devices with touch-screen.
- optional thumbnail (if you provide only the bigger version, this library will scale down your image).
- downloadable images with both a button and keyboard shortcuts. You have to set `[downloadable]="true"` and `[showExtUrlButton]="true"`.
- optional external url button. You have to set `[showExtUrlButton]="true"`.
- fully configurable description using `[description]="yourDescriptionInterfaceVariable"` passing `Description` interface with `customFullDescription`, `imageText`, `numberSeparator`, `beforeTextDescription`.
If you pass `customFullDescription`, all the others will be overwritten.
- new output events available: `(hasData)="myfunction($event)"`, `(show)="myfunction($event)"`, `(firstImage)="myfunction($event)"`, `(lastImage)="myfunction($event)"`.
- new classes/enums exported and available to all users: `Image`, `Action`, `ImageModalEvent`, `Description`.
    - `Image` is the input class with the following (mandatory) string properties: `thumb`, `img`, `description` and `extUrl`.
    - `Action` is the enum that specify the origin of the action. It can be `NORMAL`, `CLICK`, `KEYBOARD`, `SWIPE`, `LOAD`.
    - `ImageModalEvent` is the output class emitted as payload of an event. It contains both an `Action` and a result (boolean or number).
    - `Description` is the description interface with `customFullDescription`, `imageText`, `numberSeparator`, `beforeTextDescription`.
- `myfunction(event: ImageModalEvent)` can use the Action name as a string with this syntax: `Action[event.action]`, because I exported `Action` enum to all users.
- support for `ModalGalleryModule.forRoot()` to import this module inside your root module (as recommended by Angular). For a child NgModule, you must use simply `ModalGalleryModule`.

### Docs
- official documentation (bootstrap-like :)) with live demo, migration guide and features showcase [HERE](https://ks89.github.io/angular-modal-gallery.github.io/).

### Demos
